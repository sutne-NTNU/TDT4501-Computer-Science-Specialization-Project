# Code Structure

The code is organized as follows:

* `src/`: contains the fair allocation algorithms 
* `test/`: basic tests/prints to make sure the algorithms work as expected 
* `scripts/experiments/`: runs experiments and writes their results to CSV files in `results/data/`
* `scripts/plotting/`: reads CSV files from `results/data/` and plots the results in `results/plots/`
