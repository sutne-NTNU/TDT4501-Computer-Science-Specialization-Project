This project contributes to the existing literature on fair allocation of mixed goods by providing a quantitative analysis of MMS algorithms for fair allocation of mixed goods. The project examines the correlation and comparison of an indivisible goods algorithm and a mixed goods algorithm. Additionally, a quantitative analysis of using approximate MMS values when finding an allocation compared to the exact MMS values is performed. Through the experiments, the results indicate that algorithms for indivisible items work well if the divisible goods are divided into as many equal pieces as there are agents.

The main contribution of this project in then to give insight into how using already established MMS algorithms for indivisible goods can be sufficient for a fair MMS allocation of mixed goods. These results are valuable information with practical applications as if the results described in this project can be utilized for more general settings, it is a pointer that further research on MMS algorithms for mixed goods might not be necessary.
