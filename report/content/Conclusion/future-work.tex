\section{Future Work}\label{sec:future-work}

For a proper analysis of these results, and for the results to be significant it should be explored wether these results can be applied to heterogenous cake instances as well, in which case these results could indicate that the best approach to finding better MMS-allocation for mixed instances would be to find better algorithms for indivisible instances.

For this to be achieved a few things should be done:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The algorithms should be tested on a larger number of instances, and with a more varied number of agents and goods.
    \item Proof of the resulting indications must be provided.
    \item The algorithms should be tested and applied for instances with heterogenous cake.
    \item The experiments run in this report should be repeated with indivisible algorithms with higher MMS-guarantees to confirm wether these algorithms are as stable.
    \item The code used for the experimentation and algorithms must be properly peer-reviewed for quality assurance.
\end{itemize}
