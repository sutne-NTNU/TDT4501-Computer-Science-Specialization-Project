This report will look at various approaches and algorithms proposed in the relevant literature for how to handle a mixed goods setting. In \autoref{sec:preliminaries} we will define the problem and the terminology used in the report. In \autoref{sec:previous-work} we will look at the relevant literature and the different approaches that have been proposed. In \autoref{chp:method} we will present the approach used to compare and analyze these different approaches. In \autoref{chp:results} we will present the experiments we have conducted and the results we have obtained. Finally, in \autoref{chp:conclusion} we will conclude the report and discuss future work.
