\chapter{Abstract}\label{chp:abstract}

In the world of fair allocation of indivisible items and fair division of divisible items it might be wise to look at the combination of these two field. This will be the fair allocation and division of mixed goods. There already exists some work in the relevant literature about this topic, this report aims to summarize and compare these works and algorithms by looking at the allocation they each give. Finally these results will be compared to several naive/simpler algorithms to see which situations suits the different algorithms best, and if they are necessary.
